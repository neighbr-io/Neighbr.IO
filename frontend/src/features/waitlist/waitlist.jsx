      <h1>How Does It Work</h1>
      <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        At Neighbr.io, we've simplified the path to mutual success and community
        strength through a unique pledge system. Here’s how it unfolds:
      </p>

      <ol className="how-it-works-list">
        <li>
          <h1 style={{ fontSize: "40pt" }}>1</h1>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
            <strong>Pledge & Support:</strong> Community members, like you,
            pledge financial support to local businesses through Neighbr.io.
            This isn’t a loan; it’s a vote of confidence in the potential of
            neighborhood businesses.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1 style={{ fontSize: "40pt" }}>2</h1>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
            <strong>Offer & Thank: </strong> In return for your pledge,
            businesses don’t pay back with money plus interest. Instead, they
            offer their services or products as a heartfelt expression of
            gratitude, most definitely with a big discount!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1 style={{ fontSize: "40pt" }}>3</h1>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
            <strong>Strengthen & Grow:</strong> This exchange fosters a robust
            ecosystem where businesses grow without the burden of financial
            debt, and supporters enjoy local services, enriching the community
            bond.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Each pledge brings us closer, weaving a tighter, more supportive
        neighborhood fabric where businesses flourish with the community's
        backing, and every service exchanged is a story of shared growth and
        gratitude. Join Neighbr.io, and be part of this innovative journey
        towards a thriving, interconnected community.
